### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I design and run low-latency, high-throughput backends in Goâ€”event-driven services that stay fast, observable, and cost-efficient at scale. WebSockets infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers and Kafkaâ†’ClickHouse analytics that ingest ~1M events/day.

My focus: predictable throughput, low tail latency, cost-efficiency, and operability under load. I favor simple, measurable designs (clear SLIs/SLOs, backpressure, idempotency) and invest in observability, so failures are shallow and cheap.

What I bring:

 * Throughput & reliability: event-driven Go services with bounded queues, circuit-breakers and observation instrumentation.
 * Data at speed: Kafka / Redpanda (partitioning & keys that match access patterns), ClickHouse (aggregated views, TTLs, rollups).
 * Ops rigor: Kubernetes, GitOps CI/CD, Terraform & Ansible for infrastructure as code (IaC), alerting that reflects user impact.
 * Cost discipline: lean storage/egress, right-sizing, and aggregation strategies that cut waste.

Core stack: `Go`, `MongoDB`, `Kafka`, `Redpanda`, `ClickHouse`, `Redis`, `WebSockets`, `Kubernetes`, `GitOps`, `Prometheus/Grafana`.
Industries: live video, collaborative streaming, usage analytics, SaaS backends.
